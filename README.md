## Bugs and feature requests?

‚ùó **IMPORTANT: If you want to report a security related issue, please see the `Reporting security issues and bugs` section below.**

Before reporting a new issue, try to find an existing issue if one already exists. If it already exists, upvote (üëç) it. Also consider adding a comment with your unique scenarios and requirements related to that issue.  Upvotes and clear details on the issue's impact help us prioritize the most important issues to be worked on sooner rather than later. If you can't find one, that's okay, we'd rather get a duplicate report than none.

If you can't find an existing issue, log a new issue in the appropriate GitHub repository. Here are some of the most common repositories:

* [Docs](https://github.com/iot-bridge/docs)

Or browse the full list of repositories in the [IotBridge](https://github.com/iot-bridge/) organization.
